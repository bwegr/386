Wordle has become a global phenomenon, with millions of people playing it every day. Much of it's enjoyment comes from its simplicity  - just guess a five letter word. If you're a programming enthusiast, this may make it a great target for duplicating and you might find even more enjoyment by creating a Wordle game with code. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the steps involved in creating a simple Wordle game in Python.

*Disclaimer: This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of Python*

To get started, pull up a blank .py file in your favorite IDE.

This Wordle will be a very simple, bare-bones version, so feel free to add to it. We will only need to import the random package, but feel free to import other packages like string, Theme, and Console to spice up the output in the terminal and make it actually look more like the Wordle game

<code>import random</code>
